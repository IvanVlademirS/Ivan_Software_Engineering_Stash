# Strings
- #Strings are a textual datatype and must be wrapped in quotes
- can contain numeric characters, can be empty `" "`(used for spaces)
- can be double quotes or single quotes, can't use mixed quote signs
- can store strings as [[2. Variables]]
```python
color = "Magenta"
twitter_handle = '@POTUS'
url = "www.reddit.com/r/formula1/"
```

# String [[Operators]]
- We can #concatenate strings together by using the plus sign. No space will be added between them
- `+` will concatonate strings
```python
first = Luna
last = HorseLady
first + last
LunaHorseLady

first + " " + last
Luna HorseLady
```
- `*` will multiply string by integer, which will repeat thatt string
	- cant multiply a string by a number it will repeat string instead of giving product
```python
hi * 3
hihihi
```

# String Indexing
#Index = every character in the string has a corresponding number, a positional number
- starts at 0
- can use [ ] for string index
![[Pasted image 20220924153631.png]]

```python
"hello" [0]
'h'

"hello" [4]
'o'

```
- can also use negative index to read backwards

# Special value #None
- special value in Python that denotes the lack of value. It is not the same as zero or an empty string (those are still values)
- python's version of `null`'
- must be capitalized N
```python
user = None
active_user = None

# user Ivan logs in

active_user = Ivan
```

# String #Slice
- Slice cuts up index based on input
- separated by a colon
- does NOT include stopping point number in output
- `[ :4]` is the same as `[0:4]`

```python
animal = catdog
animal[3:6]
dog
```
- slices with a step (not as common)

# Revisiting [[Print]]
- if we want something outputted in our code, we have to #Print it
```python
msg = "hello!" * 99*
print(msg)
```

# #Escape Characters
- special sequences inside of python strings that start with a backslash
	- newline `\n`
	- tab `\t`
	- double quote `\"`
	- single quote `\'`
	- backslash `\\`

- to put a new line on hello world:
```python
phrase = "hello\nworld"
print(phrase)
hello
world
```

# Triple Quotes
- allows writing strings across multiple lines, for human readability
- can use single or double quotes three times
```python
address = '''
Chicken Little
123 Chicken Wing Ln
Denver Colorado 12345
'''

print(address)
Chicken Little
123 Chicken Wing Ln
Denver Colorado 12345
```

# Exercise – Nico Hulkenberg
```python
first = "Nico"

last = "Hulkenberg"

  

# - Create a variable called "full_name" that combines first and last with a space between them.  

# - Print it out

full_name = first + " " + last

print(full_name)

  
  

# - Create an "initials" variable that holds the first character of first followed by the first character of last.

# - Print it out

initials = first[0] + last[0]

print(initials)

  
  

# - Create an "initials_2" variable that holds the first character of first followed by the first character of last, with periods after each letter!

# - Print it out

initials_2 = first[0] + "." + last[0] + "."

print(initials_2)

  
  

# Create a "nickname" variable that holds the first 4 characters of "last" (use a slice)

# Print it out

# nickname = last[0:4]

nickname = last[:4]

print(nickname)
```
