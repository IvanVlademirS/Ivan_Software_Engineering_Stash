# Intro
#Variables are like labels for values
- we can store a value and give it a name so that we can:
	- refer back to it later
	- use that value 
	- change it later on
```python
age = 104
age + 1
105

score = 500
score
500

score = score * 3
score
1500
```

# Variable Naming
- can't use name that is a Python keyword
```python
help("keywords")
```

# Assignment Operators 
#Operators 
- operator followed by an `=` sign
- changes variable to new value after equation

# Print() Function
#Functions
prints out any values we pass to it to "standard output", it does not return anything
```python
print("hello")
```

# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any number you'd like:

secret_num = 13

  

# Increase secret_num by 1

secret_num += 1

  

# Next, take the new number and double it

secret_num *= 2

  

# Next, take the new number and add four to it

secret_num += 4

  

# Next, take the new number and divide by two

secret_num /= 2

  

# Next, take the new number and subtract your original secret number from it

secret_num -= 13

  

# Print the final result

print(secret_num)
